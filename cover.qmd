Dear Euclid Consortium committee,
\vspace{0.5cm}

I am writing to express my interest and motivation to become a member of the Euclid project, specifically to join the Weak Lensing (WL) and Strong Lensing (SL) Science Working Groups alongside my supervisor Dr. Raphael Gavazzi.

During my masters I have worked on a Gaussian processed based Bayesian hierarchical model of weak lensing maps at field level with Prof. Alexandre Refregier and Dr. Tilman Tröster. Recently, I have started a PhD with Dr. Raphael Gavazzi at the Laboratoire d'Astrophisique de Marseille, where I will be working on flexion lensing, with the goal of contributing to the analysis of Data Release 1 (DR1) scheduled for October 21, 2026.
\vspace{0.5cm}

Traditional weak lensing analysis measures convergence ($\kappa$) and shear ($\gamma$), which arise from second derivatives of the lensing potential and manifest as changes in galaxy ellipticity. However, as demonstrated by Bacon et al. (2006)[^1], **flexion is the significant third-order weak gravitational lensing effect responsible for the weakly skewed and arc-like appearance of lensed galaxies**.

![from Bacon et al. illustrates the hierarchy of lensing distortions with increasing spin values: convergence (spin-0), first flexion F (spin-1), shear (spin-2), and second flexion G (spin-3).](img/bacon_2006_fig1.png){width=300}

I will develop an analysis framework that:

- Validates the methodology using hydrodynamical simulations
- Extends existing $3\times2$ pt pipelines to include flexion correlation functions and cross-correlations with shear

The output I hope to achieve is:

- Detect dark matter substructure in galaxy groups and clusters
- Measure dark matter halo concentrations with factor-of-three improvements in precision
- Test modified gravity theories with these additional constraints

I am excited about the prospect of contributing to the largest weak lensing survey yet covering more than a third of the sky, and can't wait to collaborate.

Nicolò Massari
